# logv
A log viewing application, used to view logs, compare, search, or otherwise analyze logs.

# Summary
This log viewing application(written in Java so it can be platform in dependant) will be able to do many things once it is finished.
  - Compare logs, looking for ip addresses, times
  - Identify directory brute forcing, traversal, xss, SQLi, etc
  - Look at Windows event logs
  - Detect Nmap scans
  - Produce frequency charts for various things

## Supported Log Files
  - Apache2/Nginx access.log
  - MySQL error.log
  - VSFTPD vsftpd.log

## Bugs
 - SQLi detector is not working :(

## What's happening now
Right now I am working on putting everything in a GUI with each log being seperated by tabs. After the GUI is up and running, I will work on more log files.
