# logv
A log viewing application, used to view logs, compare, search, or otherwise analyze logs.


# Summary
This log viewing application(written in Java so it can be platform independant) will be able to do many things once it is finished.
  - Compare logs, looking for ip addresses, times
  - Identify directory brute forcing, traversal, xss, SQLi, etc
  - Detect Nmap scans
  - Produce frequency charts for various things
   
## Help
